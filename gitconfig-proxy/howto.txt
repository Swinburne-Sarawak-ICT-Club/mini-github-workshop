Basically using a file called ".gitconfig", you can modify the settings so that your proxy is set to it (until you change it again).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<WINDOWS ONLY> (For other OS, please find the file on your own ^.^)
You can find this file in "C:\Users>[your_username_here]" (if C:\ is your default drive).
Look for the .gitconfig file and open it with a text editor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default you should have something like

[user]
	name = Your Github Username
	email = youremail@email.com

------------------------

To set the proxy settings (for Swinburne), add these lines of code to the file:

[http]
	proxy = http://wwwproxy.swinburne.edu.my:8000
[url "https://"]
	insteadOf = git://

-----------------------

So the end result would look like this:

[user]
	name = Your Github Username
	email = youremail@email.com
[http]
	proxy = http://wwwproxy.swinburne.edu.my:8000
[url "https://"]
	insteadOf = git://

-----------------------

Remember! You must revert the file back to the original settings (without proxy) if you are not using SwinWifi. Otherwise, git will not work!

Therefore, I personally recommend that you keep two files, one for Swinburne use, and one for non-Swinburne use. Just change the file names whenever you want to change it (you can even create a script/program to do this for you).

My files: .gitconfig, .swingitconfig, .homegitconfig
I can just change the names without having to worry! :)

Have fun!
